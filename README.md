This is a simplified variant of Minesweeper 

You begin the game by clicking on any square (but be careful! Pirates lurk around every corner)

If you land on a safe patch of the map, you will be told how many squares around you are safe for your next steps.
(Please bear in mind, however, that since you can begin on any square, sometimes the number will reflect the square you're already on.)

If you cross paths with a pirate, you lose all the treasure and it's game over! 
But you're always given another chance to try again, as pirates are notoriously stubborn. 

Can you escape the island?
